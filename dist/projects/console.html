      <h2>INTRO</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to improve a product used by quants and
        researchers to build agent-based models (ABMs) in finance. My role at
        the company was to lead the design of an interface for users to
        visualise and debug their models. I was responsible for user research
        and prototyping through to high-fidelity mockups and design
        specifications.
      </p>
      <div class="grey">
        <h2>THE USER</h2>
        <p>
          Our users were from banks and research institutions, where they built
          predictive models in spreadsheets and scripting languages like Python.
          Understanding the needs and frustrations of these users was paramount
          to building a product which they would want to invest time in. To
          learn more, I began by watching them build models, reading the papers
          they wrote on those models and watching how they would present to
          their bosses. I spent time every week to talk with them and understand
          their difficulties and the problems they would most like to solve.
        </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>USER FLOW</h2>
      <p>
        Through the process of shadowing our users, I built up a simple user
        flow to help identify the most high-value problems to solve.
      </p>
      <div class="image flow full white" id="userflow">
        <img src="../assets/console/flow/flow1.svg" alt="flow1" />
        <img src="../assets/console/flow/flow2.svg" alt="flow2" />
        <img src="../assets/console/flow/flow3.svg" alt="flow3" />
        <img src="../assets/console/flow/flow4.svg" alt="flow4" />

        <img src="../assets/console/flow/flow6.svg" alt="flow6" />
      </div>

      <p>
        From initial research, it seemed that the most logical action to take
        would be to cut out steps 4 and 5, by building a console that would be
        able to inspect and run their models without the need to write any extra
        code.
      </p>
      <div class="grey">
        <h2>Agent-based Models</h2>
        <p>
          As part of my research, I built several agent-based models entirely
          from scratch and made sure to deeply understand the modelling
          paradigm. In simple terms, agent-based models are representations of
          real-world systems, made up of independent parts which interact with
          each other through a set of pre-defined attributes, links, and
          behaviours.
        </p>

        <div class="image flow width200">
          <img src="../assets/console/abm/1.svg" alt="" />
          <img src="../assets/console/abm/2.svg" alt="" />
          <img src="../assets/console/abm/3.svg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The fundamental principles of ABMs are quite intuitive, as the
          paradigm largely mimics the way the real world is laid out. The
          difficulties for our users were in building and debugging
          computational models within an agent-based framework, using tools that
          are not optimised for this way of thinking, such as spreadsheets which
          only allow one way links, and Python which would involve a large
          amount of coding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>VARIABLES</h2>
      <p>
        Building ABM into the core of the design was key to creating a product
        for our users that would distinguish us from our competitors and greatly
        improve the modelling experience. One example of a feature that was
        designed with this in mind was the way that variables were analysed from
        the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>The old way:</u> users would create global variables in their code
        and then attach them to a chart within a javascript file in their web
        template.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>The new way:</u> users would simply fire up their console to show
        their model and from there be able to access each attribute of each
        agent type.
      </p>
      <div class="grey">
        <h2>dimensionality</h2>
        <p>
          One of the key challenges that arose in designing an ABM console was
          the number of dimensions of data we had to deal with. ABMs are not
          deterministic, but probabilistic. This means they should be simulated
          many times to produce a distribution of results. So every time a model
          is simulated, data is generated for each agent attribute, and at every
          time point, creating three dimensions in the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to avoid 3D graphs at all costs because rendering many 3D
          graphs on the same page would be a UX nightmare. Instead we grouped
          together the agents and the runs of the simulation, so for example ten
          runs of ten agents would generate 100 points on the same graph. We
          would then allow the user to choose which attributes they wanted to
          display on the UI. We decided to test this feature by creating a
          clickable prototype on Sketch and giving people a set of instructions
          to see how well they could follow them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            class="pink-button"
            target="blank"
            href="https://sketch.cloud/s/e4eGj/a/znGLGW/play"
            ><mark>Sketch Prototype</mark></a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the process of continual idea generation and prototyping we
          designed a novel way of dealing with the dimensionality challenges in
          a way that avoided cluttering the interface with vast swathes of
          meaningless numbers, but which allowed the modellers to easily view
          high-level variables whilst being able to drill into lower-level
          information when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          To show the dimension of agent population and simulation runs, we give
          the user the choice of three types of chart: average, density and
          simply showing all of the data.
        </p>

          <img width="300px" src="../assets/console/dimension/1.png" alt="" />
          <img width="300px" src="../assets/console/dimension/2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>filtering</h2>
      <p>
        In solving the problem of handling so much data we had allowed the user
        to view distributions over large sets of agents and simulation runs. The
        next challenge was to allow the user to drill in to see individual
        agents, based on attribute values or tags. This was the purpose of the
        filter function, which was designed to allow the user to filter by
        results, attributes or agents.
      </p>
      <div class="image width400">
        <img src="../assets/console/filter.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="grey">
        <h2>final design</h2>
        <p>
          The final design was tested with our in-house modellers first, and
          went through various iterations with the SDK engineers in order to
          identify edge cases and refine certain areas of the UI. The graphic
          style of the UI was intended to be subtle to place focus on the data
          and the contents of the model itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model inputs and run controls were placed on a collapsible panel on
          the left hand side of the UI, with all output graphs colour coded
          based on the type of agent being displayed. Users would be able to
          hide graphs from a menu button on each graph, and bring in new graphs
          from the search box.
        </p>
        <div class="image full">
          <img class="shadow" src="../assets/console/final.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Certain features, such as the filter feature, were held back for a
          future release, but the main release was based on features prioritised
          by our users and the models they were building at that time. To
          improve upon this design a process was designed to evaluate and
          prioritise future features.
