        Designing a tool to visualise and inspect simulations
      </div>
      <p>
        My role at Simudyne was to design a product that would enable users to
        view and play through the simulations they build in real time - a tool
        that would remove the gap between their code and the ability to control
        and inspect their model.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Simudyne is an SDK for building, testing and deploying ‚Äòagent-based‚Äô
        models.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our users were researchers and analysts who want to test the sanity of
        their theories using cloud computing and novel paradigms such as
        agent-based modelling without the need of a computer scientist. The use
        cases range from testing central bank policies to molecular
        interactions. The challenge was to design a product general enough to
        visualise any simulation, whilst meeting the specific needs of each.
      </p>
      <h3>Conducting research</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in this project was to identify the tasks common to all
        users. Since the product is not a mass consumer product, but rather a
        niche technology used by researchers in banks and universities, this
        involved shadowing users to understand how they used the product, and
        one-to-one user interviews. At the end of this process, the tasks, pains
        and success criteria of our users were brought together to understand
        the problem which needed to be solved.

      <h1>Modellers needed a tool to build and test their simulations.</h1>
      <p>
        I held a workshop with our in-house modellers, some of our users, and
        our developers, to generate ideas and features that would alleviate
        pains or allow them to achieve what they wanted more easily. These ideas
        and features were ranked by usefulness and cost, with the best ones
        later being used to create a new user flow for how a modeller would now
        use our product.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reimagining the user journey
      </h3>
      <p>
        The journey of the user begins at the model design stage. The user would
        then build the model using the Simudyne SDK, and in real-time, test
        results and variables in a web based inspector. Once the model is
        completed, it would then be available in a model lake to allow the user
        to chain it with other models and conduct larger experiments. The user
        flow was divided into features of the first design iteration, and
        features that would come at a later stage. An example of a real use case
        is given to bring the user journey to life.

      <h3>Generating ideas</h3>
      <p>
        Aside from interviewing and shadowing users, I studied some of the
        models they were building, as the test of a good design would be to
        cater for all the models they were building.
